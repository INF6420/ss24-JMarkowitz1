        <h1> Introduction to Jennifer</h1>
        <p>Hello my name is Jennifer Markowitz. I am a current Masters in Library and Information Science at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. My goal is to one day hopefully go into Digital Archives. I was born in Williamsburg, Virginia but have lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida for the majority of my life. I went to school at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida to earn my Bachelors in History in 2018. During my time at UCF I was a puppy raiser for Canine Companions for Independence and raised both Allin and Juffy. I was also lucky enough to present a poster at American Society of Overseas Research Conference in 2018 in collaboration with my professor.
